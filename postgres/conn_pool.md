**Session-Level Pooling in PostgreSQL**  
Session-level pooling refers to a connection pooling strategy where a database connection is allocated to a client for the entire duration of its session. This means the connection remains dedicated to that client until the session ends, preserving any session-specific state (e.g., temporary tables, variables, or configuration settings). Tools like **PgBouncer** implement this mode, making it ideal for applications requiring consistent session state but less efficient under high concurrency due to longer-held connections.

**Other Pooling Levels**  
1. **Transaction-Level Pooling**  
   - Connections are assigned to a client **only for the duration of a single transaction**. After the transaction completes (commit/rollback), the connection is returned to the pool.  
   - **Pros**: Higher connection reuse, reducing the need for a large pool.  
   - **Cons**: Session state (e.g., `SET` variables, temporary objects) is lost between transactions.  

2. **Statement-Level Pooling**  
   - Connections are reused **after each individual SQL statement**. This is the most granular but least common approach.  
   - **Pros**: Maximizes connection reuse.  
   - **Cons**: Breaks multi-statement transactions and cannot maintain session/transaction state.  

**Trade-offs**  
- **Session Pooling**: Best for stateful workloads but requires more connections.  
- **Transaction/Statement Pooling**: Efficient for stateless workloads but incompatible with session-dependent features.  

**Tools Supporting These Modes**  
- **PgBouncer** (popular PostgreSQL connection pooler) explicitly supports all three modes: `session`, `transaction`, and `statement`.  
- Other poolers (e.g., **pgPool-II**) may offer similar configurations.  

**Example Use Cases**  
- **Session Pooling**: Applications using temporary tables or session-specific configurations.  
- **Transaction Pooling**: Stateless web apps with short-lived transactions (e.g., REST APIs).  
- **Statement Pooling**: Rarely used due to transactional integrity requirements.  

In summary, PostgreSQL connection poolers optimize resource usage by offering different pooling levels, each balancing state retention and connection efficiency.
